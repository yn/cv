Cofounder and Director of Research
Eluciv Knowledge
May 2007 – May 2008 (1 year 1 month)Brooklyn, NY
Directed machine learning research and development efforts at Eluciv Knowledge, a startup focused on reducing information overload. The initial product was going to be a reader for syndicated (RSS/Atom) feeds, with planned advanced features such as implicit acquisition of user's interests, recommendations using collaborative and content-based filtering, and sorting by personal relevance. The team consisted of three co-founders.

- Led the planning of scaling the adaptive feed reader product, which would scan and store a large number of feeds, and provide specific article recommendations to individual users.

- Researched free and commercial machine learning libraries and clustering packages such as Weka, CLUTO, Carrot2 and Lemur, and evaluated the possibility of adapting them as engines for determining personal relevance.

- Researched parallel and distributed computing platforms such as Amazon Web Services, Apache Hadoop and Google MapReduce.

- Primary contributor in the development of the product vision, the business plan and the revenue model.

- Designed and developed a prototype content archiver and delivery system using Amazon Web Services (S3, EC2, SimpleDB). The system was written in C and Python.

- Built an alpha version of the product that won a highly sought after YCombinator funding round. Used Ruby on Rails for speed of development.
Senior Software Engineer
The Confidentiality Group
August 2000 – May 2007 (6 years 10 months)New York , NY
First employee at a company serving top-tier investment banks and other highly regulated large enterprises. Designed and developed the flagship product, which is a platform for customers to ensure that they remain in compliance with auditing and information access laws and regulations. The platform provides an entitlement and storage engine for confidential electronic documents. It ensures that all user access to documents through email, web applications, and filesystems, goes through a flexible and powerful authorization and reporting layer. The team grew from two to seven members over time.

- Implemented several iterations of the entitlement engine which supported fine-grained and fully versioned access control. The engine ran on JBoss AS, with Hibernate and MySQL providing persistence.

- Designed a cross-browser AJAX framework (jQuery was not yet available) and implemented several iterations of the UI used for the entitlement engine.

- Designed, implemented and maintained a set of Citrix Client and Microsoft Office plug-ins that seamlessly incorporated editing and emailing confidential documents into the user's natural workflow.

- Implemented client-specific requirements and integrated the product with clients' in-house infrastructure.

- Supervised testing and performed monthly on-site rollouts.
